== FAQ ==

**Do you have some hidden costs linked to the number of messages exchanged?**

We don't want you to worry about how much Joonbot will cost you every month, that's why our pricing is fixed, no hidden costs.

Whatever your chatbot has 50 000 or 5 millions interactions, you'll pay the same price.

**Where does the data go?**

We store the data on european servers. We created features that will allow you to get the data and use it the way you want.

First, you can see all conversations your chatbots had with users on the results tab.

Using our integrations, you can send data to Google Sheets, Airtable and many more apps. You can also send it to your own backoffice.

You can also export data as CSV, so you'll access to ended and unfinished conversations.

**On which platforms are Joonbot available?**

We only focus on chatbots for websites. We want to rely only on our own technology to get your data safe.

**Do I need to know how to code?**

Not at all, you only need basic copy/paste skills for the setup :).

You can also use our native email, Zapier, Integrately and Google Sheets integrations to automate process, no coding is required.

However, if you want to use our Webhook feature, you need to code. For info, more native integrations are coming soon!

**Does Joonbot work with Artificial Intelligence?**

No. The mechanism is rule-based, you define your conversational scenarios in advance.
